How to detect scroll position of page using jQuery

I am having following jQuery functionality in my website, what it does that is it uses window.scroll() function to recognize when the windows changes scroll position changes and at the change call few function to load data from server.

The problem is the .scroll() function is called as soon as there is even a little change in the scroll position and load data at the bottom however what I wish to achieve is load new data when the scroll/page position reaches at the bottom, like is happens for Facebook feed.

But I am not sure how to detect scroll position using jQuery?

function getData() {
  $.getJSON('Get/GetData?no=1', function (responseText) {
    //Load some data from the server
  })
};

$(window).scroll(function () {
    getData();
});

You can extract the scroll position using jQuery's .scrollTop() method

$(window).scroll(function (event) {
    var scroll = $(window).scrollTop();
    // Do something
});

Attaching events to window scroll is a bad idea : see stackoverflow.com/questions/5036850/… – hendr1x Jan 29 '15 at 17:12

Listening to window scroll isn't bad in and of itself. It's when people try to do things on each firing of that event that trouble occurs. If you only do something like set a variable's value to the current scroll position, or to true/false, and then make use of those outside the event, you should generally be golden. – Jesse Dupuy May 12 '15 at 17:18

You should consider debouncing when working with this kind of events. See davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function – caroso1222 Mar 11 '16 at 17:26

You are looking for the window.scrollTop() function.

$(window).scroll(function() {
    var height = $(window).scrollTop();

    if(height  > some_number) {
        // do something
    }
});

Check here DEMO http://jsfiddle.net/yeyene/Uhm2J/

function getData() {
    $.getJSON('Get/GetData?no=1', function (responseText) {
        //Load some data from the server
    })
};

$(window).scroll(function() {
   if($(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height() == $(document).height()) {
       alert("bottom!");
       // getData();
   }
});

$(window).scroll( function() { 
 var scrolled_val = $(document).scrollTop().valueOf();
 alert(scrolled_val+ ' = scroll value');
});

This is another way of getting the value of scroll.

Store the value of the scroll as changes in HiddenField when around the PostBack retrieves the value and adds the scroll.

//jQuery

jQuery(document).ready(function () {

    $(window).scrollTop($("#<%=hidScroll.ClientID %>").val());

    $(window).scroll(function (event) {
        $("#<%=hidScroll.ClientID %>").val($(window).scrollTop());
    });
});

var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();

prm.add_endRequest(function () {

    $(window).scrollTop($("#<%=hidScroll.ClientID %>").val());

    $(window).scroll(function (event) {
        $("#<%=hidScroll.ClientID %>").val($(window).scrollTop());
    });
});

//Page Asp.Net
<asp:HiddenField ID="hidScroll" runat="server" Value="0" />

Now that works for me...

$(document).ready(function(){

    $(window).resize(function(e){
        console.log(e);                   
    });

    $(window).scroll(function (event) {
        var sc = $(window).scrollTop();
        console.log(sc);
    });

})

it works well... and then you can use JQuery/TweenMax to track elements and control them.
